\chapter{Advanced Features: AI Proctoring}

\section{The Integrity Challenge}
Remote exams are prone to cheating. Our system solves this without invasive desktop software.

\section{Browser-Based Detection}
We use \texttt{TensorFlow.js} running entirely in the browser.

\node[right=1cm of logic] {If gaze\_angle > 45 deg};

\section{Privacy First}
Since analysis happens on the client:
\begin{itemize}
    \item No video is streamed to servers (bandwidth friendly).
    \item Only "violation snapshots" are uploaded.
    \item Biometric data is deleted after the exam session.
\end{itemize}
